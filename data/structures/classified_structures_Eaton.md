**Structure damage classification using the OpenStreetMap buildings shapefiles and CAL FIRE DINS database.**

The shapefiles are the OpenStreetMap building vector dataset joined with the DINS database structure classifications. All information from OSM/DINS are included, with an additional row, "DamageCode." The DamageCode is assigned 1 for burned (DINS Destroyed (>50%)) and 0 for unburned (DINS = No Damage). Partially damaged structures are ommitted in this dataset.
